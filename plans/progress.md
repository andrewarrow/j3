## 2026-05-18

### 2026-05-18 - OPS-001 - Persistent planning migration

- Owner: coordinator
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `plans/operating-model.md`,
  `plans/backlog.md`, `plans/active.md`, `plans/progress.md`,
  `plans/today.md`, `plans/today.progress.md`
- Tests: `git diff --check` passed
- Result: replaced the old 24-hour `today.md` loop with a persistent
  coordinator/backlog/progress model. Added explicit rules for bounded parallel
  workers, coordinator reviews, disjoint write scopes, and evidence-led task
  selection.
- Commit: none
- Push: none
- Next: begin with `TRANS-001`, `GS7-001`, or `DATA-001` from the ready queue.
- Blockers: none

### 2026-05-18 - OPS-001 - Model selection policy

- Owner: coordinator
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `plans/operating-model.md`,
  `plans/progress.md`
- Tests: `git diff --check` passed
- Result: documented that the coordinator should run at `xhigh`, default
  workers at `high`, mechanical workers at `medium`, and hard
  architecture/research workers at `xhigh`.
- Commit: none
- Push: none
- Next: commit the planning migration, then start the agent loop from fresh
  context.
- Blockers: none
